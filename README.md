# We-Are-Number-One-Meme-Generator
A We Are Number One Meme Generator. This program takes in a video file, and replaces every "one" in the "We are number one" video with the input video.

To use this, you must have python 2.7.9 installed on your computer, and the moviepy package must be downloaded (http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/).
Go to your command line prompt, and type "python WAN1Gen.py", then follow the steps.
Make sure you're video file you want to include is in the same path as the python script.
