# We-Are-Number-One-Meme-Generator
A We Are Number One Meme Generator. This program takes in a video file, and replaces every "one" in the "We are number one" video with the input video.

To use this, you must have python 3.5 (www.python.org), the moviepy package (http://zulko.github.io/moviepy/), pillow 2.9.0 (pip install pillow == 2.9.0), and pyqt5 (pip install pyqt5).
Go to your command line prompt, and type "python main.py", then follow the steps.
Make sure you're video file you want to include is in the same path as the python script.
